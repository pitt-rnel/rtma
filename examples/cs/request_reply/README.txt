This example consists of two simple C# modules, Request and Reply.

You can use this code as a starting point to develop your own modules, or just use it to test 
if Dragonfly is correctly compiled and working. 

Compile the project on Windows by opening CsProject.sln in Visual Studio (has been tested with Visual Studio 2005) 

Make sure the MessageManager is running.

First run Reply in a command window. Then run Request in a separate command window.
