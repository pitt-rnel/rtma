This example consists of two simple C# modules, Producer and Consumer.

You can use this code as a starting point to develop your own modules, or just use it to test 
if Dragonfly is correctly compiled and working. 

Compile the project on Windows by opening CsModules.sln in Visual Studio (has been tested with Visual Studio 2005) 

Make sure the MessageManager is running.

First run Producer in a command window. Then run Consumer in a separate command window.
