This example consists of two simple C++ modules, Request and Reply.

You can use this code as a starting point to develop your own modules, or just use it to test 
if RTMA is correctly compiled and working. 

Before starting the modules, make sure the MessageManager is running.

Note that Reply should be started first, and the Request should be started second. 


On Windows
==========

The folder contains ready-to-run executables for the example code.

When you make changes to the code, compile the project by opening the CppProject.sln in Visual Studio 
(has been tested with Visual Studio 2017)



On Linux
========

On linux the example code needs to be compiled. To compile the code, run "make all" in a terminal.
