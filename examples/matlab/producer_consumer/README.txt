This example consists of two simple Matlab modules, Producer and Consumer.

You can use this code as a starting point to develop your own modules, or just use it to test 
if Dragonfly is correctly compiled and working. 

Make sure the MessageManager is running.

Run build_message_defs.m in a Matlab instance to create the message definitions file.

First run Producer in a Matlab instance. Then run Consumer in a separate Matlab instance.
