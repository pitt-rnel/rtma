This example consists of two simple python modules, Request and Reply.

You can use this code as a starting point to develop your own modules, or just use it to test 
if RTMA is correctly compiled and working. 


Run the example as follows:

   1. Make sure the PYTHONPATH environment variable has a reference to %RTMA%/lang/python folder

   2. Make sure MessageManager is running
   
   3. Run Reply in a terminal: 
		python Reply.py 
   
   4. Run Request in a separate terminal
		python Request.py 
   
   5. Verify that Request receives messages sent by Reply.
